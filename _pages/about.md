## About Me  

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Hunan University**. I have collaborated with [Yizhen Lao](https://yizhenlao.github.io/) on **3D point cloud registration** and **adversarial attacks**.  

From **September 2024 to February 2025**, I was fortunate to participate in a **research internship** at **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)** under the supervision of [Prof. LUO Qiong](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~luo/).  

Currently, my research interests lie in **AI for Chemistry**, where I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and chemical applications.
