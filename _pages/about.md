## About Me  

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Hunan University. I have collaborated with [Prof. LAO Yizhen](https://yizhenlao.github.io/) on 3D point cloud registration and adversarial attacks. I was fortunate to participate in a research internship at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the supervision of [Prof. LUO Qiong](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~luo/). Currently, my research interests lie in AI for Chemistry.
